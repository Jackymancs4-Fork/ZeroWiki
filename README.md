# ZeroWiki
ZeroWiki is a browser extension to load Wikipedia from the 0wikipedia.org domain instead of wikipedia.org. 

## Download
You can currently download ZeroWiki from [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zerowiki/cklaghejbnabhfdlaelhbjdepkfodkcj) and [Mozilla Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/zerowiki/). Other platforms will be listed here as they become available.

## Manual Installation
If ZeroWiki is not available for your browser, you can manually download this repository and add it as an extension to your browser if your browser supports extensions. It should work with most of the browsers since ZeroWiki is as simple an extension as it gets, however please let me know if it doesn't so I can try to make some arrangements.

## How It Works
ZeroWiki doesn't do anything fancy. It just redirects your requests to wikipedia.org to 0wikipedia.org, which is generally available. 0wikipedia.org is the domain used by the Wikipedia Zero project developed by Wikimedia Foundation. You can get more information about Wikipedia Zero from [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_Zero) or [here](https://en.0wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_Zero).
